It is\r\ndesigned to be near to natural language, thus simple, and shall cover\r\nanalytical as well as numerical things.\r\n\r\nState\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhat you get when you clone this is a very early prototype. It is badly coded\r\nand if I dont throw away this prototype completely I'm a jerk. In addition it\r\nis even uncertain if I abandon this project at some point. Dont throw your time\r\nin here if its not for fun. The syntax will probably change as well in the future.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
